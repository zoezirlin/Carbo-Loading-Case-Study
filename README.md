84.51 Carbo-Loading Kroger Case Study


Analysis of longitudinal sales data for 5 million Kroger shoppers over two years. This code includes the unit market share for each brand, sales market share, and I'm currently working on the next set of business metrics for each category and brand. Not expecting to find surprising linear relationships between variables, (having already looked at the pearson correlations,) but will conduct series of logistic and multivariate linear regressions to better flush out shopper patterns.
